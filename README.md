# Bake It Better

Bake It Better is a blog-style website for users to share baking recipes (also referred to as "bakes"). All users are able to browse bakes, and once users have created an account and signed in they can add, edit and delete their own.

- Signed-in users are also able to 'star' baking recipes. The star functions as both a like and a bookmark; users can view a list of all the bakes that they have starred.

- In addition, when a user creates an account they can access their own "Best For" Bakes section. This provides the user with what is essentially a planner function, where they can plan in bakes for a particular occasion e.g. a bake to take to a party or a recipe that is good for kids to bake.

Bake It Better has been developed using Agile methodology, and is written using Python + Django, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

The site has been created for the fourth portfolio project for Code Institute's Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.

### General Coding Skills

I made extensive use of various online resources to improve my understanding and knowledge before and during this project, including:

- reading about correct development of user stories as opposed to dev tasks on [Industrial Logic](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/as-a-developer-is-not-a-user-story/) and refinement of Epics to User Stories via [Christian Strunk](https://www.christianstrunk.com/blog/user-stories-and-epics-for-the-win)
- working through [Codecademy's Django tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-python-web-apps-with-django), which was particularly useful for learning how to write the different types of class-based views in Django
- referring to [VeryAcademy's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/veryacademy) for more info on several aspects of Django as well as revisiting Bootstrap
- reading through much of the [Django documentation](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)
- using [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for troubleshooting and debugging a number of issues, the more project-specific of which are highlighted in the following section
- reminding myself of some HTML and, in particular, CSS basics at [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

### Specific to the Project

- baking recipes from GBBO and BBC Good Food
- wireframes using Balsamiq
- specific Stack Overflow articles
